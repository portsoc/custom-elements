<h1>Custom Element Example 4</h1>

<p>This sentence includes (right here: <my-clock></my-clock>) a live and working clock that is completely encapsulated within a web component.  The web component is defined in a separate file that can be included in any page.  The clock appears red because it has it's own stylesheet that is defined as part of the component.</p>
<p>This second clocks has seconds too... <my-clock seconds />)
